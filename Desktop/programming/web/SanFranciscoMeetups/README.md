#All-Inclusive Guide to Bay Area Tech meetups

Do you want to get better at programming? Maybe you want to network, improve job prospects, listen to cool talks, and meet amazing people. WELL THEN…you should go to some tech meetups all over the Bay Area! But there's so many, you protest!

As a devangelist intern last summer in the heart of SoMa (South of Market, San Francisco), I attended up to four meetups per week! I loved going for the lively discussions with engineers, evangelists, designers, students, and a plethora of people from not just San Francisco or the Bay Area, but from all over the world. I relished office visits, swag, raffles, talks, workshops, and just the atmosphere in general. Though I was often one of the only, if not the only, intern, I was treated exactly like any other meetup attendee. 

There was often an aura of creativity, innovation, startup ideas, and it was amazing how I could learn something from everyone I met, and also teach them some things, too (I hope.) 

In this repo, I will highlight my favorite meetups, where to find meetups, speaking at meetups (if you so desire), networking, different categories of meetups, meetups by location, and more. Pull requests welcomed!

## Where to look for meetups

Yes, [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) is A+. They have so many meetups (not just tech-related), and meetups in locations all over the world! Many of the meetups here are monthly, weekly, or meet routinely. Similarly, I also recommend [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) for more special meetups (less routine), as well as hackathons and conferences. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) also has a few, which I often find in tech-related groups (Hackathon Hackers, Ladies Storm Hackathons, but more often, in their subgroups, often targeted at location or platform ie iOS, web, IoT, etc.)

##Top meetups (in my opinion)
[SFHTML5](https://www.meetup.com/sfhtml5/events/237037342/) takes the cake, and not just because I left each one with wine! Well-organized, friendly and knowledgeable speakers and attendees, good food, and great location. Held at Google SF, the $10 ticket fee is just to discourage no-shows. Organized by [Vanessa Wang](https://twitter.com/vjwang) and [Peter Lubbers](https://twitter.com/peterlubbers), SFTHML5 has me coming back every time.
[TwitterDev](https://www.meetup.com/pro/twitterdev/) There are TwitterDev meetups held all over the world. Past SF meetups have been at Twitter HQ, PubNub, and others. Great speakers and people.

## Meetups by location

<br>
### SoMa meetups

<br>
### Palo Alto meetups

<br>
##Networking

Connections are very useful -- you should meet as many people as you can in your industry. They can help you land interviews and improve the company's opinion of you (and vice versa).

### Keep in touch

## Conclusion

There are a lot of ways to increase your chances of getting an internship. Do not simply upload your resume to their website. Good luck on your search!
